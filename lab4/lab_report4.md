- Key pressed: `cat ListExamples.java` + `<ENTER>`
- `vim ListExamples.java`: `<esc>` + `:44` + `e` + `x` + `i` + `2`+ `<esc>` + `:wq`
> `cat` prints the file in terminal to check the codes before debugging
> `vim` enters vim mode to edit file within the terminal
> `:44` goes to line 44 where I found the bug with cat, `e` goes to the last character of the current word, `x` deletes the last character, `i` changes vim mode to insert, where I change  `1` to `2`, after modification is done,  `<esc>` exits the insert mode and `:wq` saves the edit of the file and exit.
